Snowden began his career in 2005 as a security specialist for the University of Maryland’s Center for Advanced Security of Language. In 2006, he was hired by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia as an IT professional. Working for the CIA, he discovered the surveillance system infiltrated the privacy of the general public and so started collecting documents. There were suspicions that he broke into top classified documents and the NSA had to let him go. Snowden then joined Dell, in one of NSA’s offices in Japan and worked as a subcontractor from 2009 until 2013.

Edward then joined another tech company in Booz Allen Hamilton where he worked for three months. While working for the company he started growing interests in the work of the NSA and their hidden files. Finally, he devised ways to break into the top-secret vaults in NSA’s system. He found out more about the immoral and unethical practices of the NSA and figured that it needed to be halted immediately. Snowden wanted to aware people about the work NSA was doing and started collecting a massive amount of information to prove his point.
